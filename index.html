        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Diego Perez, I am a third year Economics student at University of California Riverside, and I am pursuing a role in Data Analytics. 
        In the beginninng of my college experience, I attended Pasadena City College for three years and then transfered to University of California Riverside.  Originally I was a Computer Science Major in Pasadena, but quickly I realized I didn't like the major.
        Throughout the three years, I switched majors trying to figure out what I wanted to do in college and after. After not wanting to do Computer science, I looked at what type of classes I liked and one of the classes I enjoyed was my chemistry class and decided to try in major in that.
        While starting to do the Chemistry degree I realized, I liked the subject of Chemistry but I didn't like much of the job opportunities and also didn't like lab reports.  After I decided to try Civil engineering since I already finished all of the Calculus series.  After taking one Physics
        class, I realized I didn't like engineering at all.  Eventually in my second year I decided to major in Economics since it was something I could understand.  When I was taking the Economics classes, they 
        were new to me, but since they all required some from of math, it made it eaiser for me to understand.  <br><br>

        When I started going to University of California Riverside, I was glad that I finally got into a university but I still didn't know what I wanted to do with my degree.  The only careers I knew were related to finance, until I found out about Data Analysis.
        Apparently you can be a Data Analyst with any degree, but the majors that are closely related were Statistics, Economics, and Computer Science.  The more I learned about Data Analysis, the more I realized I can use my degree for this position. After my first quarter at UCR, I decided to take a certificate
        course with Google called the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate".  While doing this certificate and talking to people who work in data science, I realized this carreer might be the perfect fit for me since you have to learn constantly, throughout the years, and you have to be able to look at 
        data and understand it.<br><br>

        Data Analysis requires you to have some knowledge of certain computer programming software, which I didn't have much experience in, so this certificateis helping me learn the basic type of tools.  Even though I have taken one computer science class, It was not the type I needed.  The certificate also taught me the foundations of Data Science and how to think.  This way of thinking was interesting that made 
        me realized I have done this before.  If you hire me for a position in Data Analysis, I will be sure to give my best work and help in any company I can.
